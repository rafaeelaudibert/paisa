# Configuration

All the configuration related to paisa is stored in a yaml file named
`paisa.yaml`. The configuration can be edited via the web
interface. The sequence in which paisa looks for the file is described
below

1. `PAISA_CONFIG` environment variable
1. via `--config` flag
1. Current working directory
1. `paisa/paisa.yaml` file inside User Documents folder.

If it can't find the configuration file, it will create a default
configuration file named `paisa/paisa.yaml` inside User Documents folder. The
default configuration is tuned for Indians, users from other countries
would have to change the `default_currency` and `locale`.

### Accounts

In many places, paisa expects you to specify a list of accounts. You
can type the full account name like `#!ledger
Account:Equity:APPL`. Paisa also supports wildcard `*`, you can use
`#!ledger Account:Equity:*` to represent all accounts under
Equity. It's also possible to use negation. `#!ledger !Expenses:Tax`
will match all accounts except Tax. If you use negation, then all the
accounts should be negation. Don't mix negation with others, if done
the behavior will be undefined.
