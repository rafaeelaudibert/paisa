# Savings

Savings represents a general financial objective that you want to
achieve, like buying a car, or a house, or a vacation.

```yaml
goals:
  retirement:
    - name: House
      target: 5000000
      icon: fluent-emoji-high-contrast:house-with-garden
      accounts:
        - Assets:Equity:*
        - Assets:Debt:*
```

Specify the target amount, and the accounts that you keep the money in.
