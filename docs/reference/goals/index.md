# Goals

Goal helps you track your financial objective and progress. You can
create a goal for any financial objective you have, such as saving for
a vacation, or building an emergency fund or planning for retirement.

Paisa currently supports two types of goals:

1. [Retirement](./retirement.md)
2. [Savings](./savings.md)


More goal types will be added in the future. Feel free to create a
[discussion](https://github.com/ananthakumaran/paisa/discussions) if you have any suggestions.


### Create Goal

To add a new goal, go to the `Configuration` page and expand the goals
section. You would see a list of goal types. Expand the type you want
to add and click on the :fontawesome-solid-circle-plus: icon to add a
new goal. The configuration details are available in the respective
goal type pages.


!!! example "Under Development"

    Goals is currently under development and you might see changes
    with every new release. If you want to share feedback, this is a
    good time to do so.
